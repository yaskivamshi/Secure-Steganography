# Secure-Steganography
# Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography

## Project Description
This project implements a secure data hiding technique using steganography. It allows you to hide secret data (text or binary) in an image and extract it back securely. The hidden data is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. The project uses the [Steganography Algorithm] for hiding and extracting data.

## Features
- **Hide data in images**: You can embed any text or file data into a carrier image.
- **Extract hidden data**: Extract hidden data from images.
- **Encryption**: The hidden data is encrypted for security before being embedded into the image.
- **Decryption**: Hidden data is decrypted before extraction for secure recovery.
- **Supported image formats**: The project supports common image formats like `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pillow` for image processing
  - `cryptography` for data encryption
  - `numpy` for matrix manipulations
  - `opencv-python` (optional, if used for advanced image manipulation)
