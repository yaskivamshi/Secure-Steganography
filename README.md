# Secure Steganography: Hiding Data in Images  

![Steganography Example](samples/example.png)  

## 🔒 Overview  
Secure Steganography is a Python-based project that embeds confidential data into images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique** combined with **AES encryption**. This enhances **covert communication** and **data security** by ensuring hidden messages remain undetectable.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Undetectable Communication** – Hides encrypted messages in images without altering visible properties.  
✅ **AES Encryption** – Ensures an extra layer of security before embedding.  
✅ **Minimal File Size Increase** – Efficient data hiding with negligible size impact.  
✅ **Steganography Techniques** – Supports multiple methods (LSB, DCT, etc.).  
✅ **Robust Against Attacks** – Works even after minor image modifications.  
✅ **Easy Extraction** – Retrieve and decrypt the hidden message seamlessly.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, PIL, pycryptodome  
- **Encryption:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
